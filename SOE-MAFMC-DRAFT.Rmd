# `Introduction`

The purpose of this report is to provide ecosystem-scale information for fishery managers to consider along with existing species-scale analyses. An overview of ecosystem relationships as represented by a conceptual model helps place more detailed species-level management in context by highlighting relationships between focal species groups organized by the `r council` (`r council_abbr`) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), human activities, environmental drivers, habitats, and key ecological links (Fig. \ref{fig:conceptual-model}). Here, human activities indicators in this report, and key paths connecting components and objectives are highlighted.

```{r conceptual-model, out.height="50%", fig.cap="A conceptual model visualizing relationships among Mid-Atlantic Bight ecosystem components. \\label{conceptual-model}"}

# `Executive Summary`

We have organized this report using a proposed set of ecosystem-scale objectives (Table \ref{tab:management-objectives}) derived from US legislation and current management practices. We report indicators at the spatial scale of either the `r epu` (`r epu_abbr`; Fig. \ref{EPU-MAP}) or entire Northeast coast where appropriate. Indicator spatial scale is noted in each section heading (**Do we want to keep this layout?**)

 
```{r management-objectives}

mng_obj <- data.frame("Objective Categories" = c("Seafood Production",
                                                 "Profits","Recreation",
                                                 "Stability","Social & Cultural",
                                                 "Biomass","Productivity",
                                                 "Trophic structure","Habitat"),
"Indicators reported here" = c("Landings by feeding guild","Revenue by feeding guild",
                               "Number of anglers and trips; recreational catch",
                               "Diversity indices (fishery and species)",
                               "Commercial and recreational reliance; social vulnerability",

                               "Estimated habitat occurrence and potential wind-energy interactions")) 

knitr::kable(mng_obj,
      col.names = c("Objective Categories","Indicators reported here"),
      caption = "Established ecosystem-scale objectives in the Mid-Atlantic Bight \\label{management-objectives}",

      booktabs = T) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>% 
  column_spec(c(2), width = c("25em")) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)

```

We also report single-species status relative to established objectives and references points. The `r council_abbr` is meeting objectives at the managed species (i.e. stockwide) level for fishing mortality (F) rates for **inline R code** of **here** and biomass levels for **inline R code** of **here** stocks relative to established reference points (Fig. \ref{stock-status}).

```{r EPU-MAP, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "The Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem. \\label{EPU-MAP}"}

#Specify data frame with lat/lon locations for labels
epu_labels <- data.frame(EPU = c("Mid-Atlantic\n Bight",
                                 "Gulf of Maine",
                                 "Georges Bank"),
                         latitude = c(40,42.85,41),
                         longitude = c(-72.75,-69,-68.5))

# `Changes for 2019`
This section will likely be included as an appendix.

Many metrics have been developed to aggregate species into functional groups. Similar groupings have been developed for previous editions of this report, which we refer to as feeding guilds. We have continued to improve upon these groupings to better reflect ecological reality, and show feeding guilds with key composite species in Table \ref{tab:species-groupings}.
**FYI these are last year's groupings**

Seafood production is a stated goal of optimal fishery management as part of the defintion of "benefits to the nation" under MSA. Both commercial and recreational fishing contributes to seafood production, the latter for personal consumption, and indicators for each of these human activities track management performance against this objective. 

The `r council_abbr` only manages a portion of the total commercial landings that occur in the `r epu_abbr` region. For example, `r example_common_name`s represent a substantial portion of `r feeding_guild` landings. For the year `r latest_landings_data`, `r council_abbr` managed species accounted for `r round(inline_landings * 100)`% of the Benthivore landings and `r round(inline_revenue * 100)`% of the revenue generated from those landings in the `r epu_abbr`. These proportions are highlighted below in Table \ref{tab:land-rev-props}.

```{r land-rev-props}

knitr::kable(land_rev_prop,
      caption = "Proportion of landings and revenue derived from managed species in the Mid-Atlantic region. \\label{land-rev-props}",
      align = 'c',
      booktabs = T) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
