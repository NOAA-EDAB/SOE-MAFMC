# `Introduction`

The purpose of this report is to provide ecosystem-scale information for fishery managers to consider along with existing species-scale analyses. An overview of ecosystem relationships as represented by a conceptual model helps place more detailed species-level management in context by highlighting relationships between focal species groups organized by the `r council` (`r council_abbr`) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), human activities, environmental drivers, habitats, and key ecological links (Fig. \ref{fig:conceptual-model}). Here, human activities indicators in this report, and key paths connecting components and objectives are highlighted.

```{r conceptual-model, out.height="50%", fig.cap=paste0("A conceptual model visualizing relationships among ",epu," ecosystem components. \\label{conceptual-model}")}

if (epu_abbr == "MAB"){
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, "SOE_MAB_ConceptMod.png"))
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'ne_conceptual_model.pdf'))
}

```

# `Executive Summary`

We have organized this report using a proposed set of ecosystem-scale objectives (Table \ref{tab:management-objectives}) derived from US legislation and current management practices. We report indicators at the spatial scale of either the `r epu` (`r epu_abbr`; Fig. \ref{EPU-MAP}) or entire Northeast coast where appropriate. Indicator spatial scale is noted in each section heading (**Do we want to keep this layout?**)

 
```{r management-objectives}

mng_obj <- data.frame("Objective Categories" = c("Seafood Production",
                                                 "Profits","Recreation",

We also report single-species status relative to established objectives and references points. The `r council_abbr` is meeting objectives at the managed species (i.e. stockwide) level for fishing mortality (F) rates for **inline R code** of **here** and biomass levels for **inline R code** of **here** stocks relative to established reference points (Fig. \ref{stock-status}).

# `Changes for 2019`
This section will likely be included as an appendix.

Many metrics have been developed to aggregate species into functional groups. Similar groupings have been developed for previous editions of this report, which we refer to as feeding guilds. We have continued to improve upon these groupings to better reflect ecological reality, and show feeding guilds with key composite species in Table \ref{tab:species-groupings}.
**FYI these are last year's groupings and specific to MAB**

## Seafood production (`r epu_abbr`)

Seafood production is a stated goal of optimal fishery management as part of the defintion of "benefits to the nation" under MSA. Both commercial and recreational fishing contributes to seafood production, the latter for personal consumption, and indicators for each of these human activities track management performance against this objective. 

The `r council_abbr` only manages a portion of the total commercial landings that occur in the `r epu_abbr` region. For example, `r example_common_name`s represent a substantial portion of `r feeding_guild` landings. For the year `r latest_landings_data`, `r council_abbr` managed species accounted for `r round(inline_landings * 100)`% of the Benthivore landings and `r round(inline_revenue * 100)`% of the revenue generated from those landings in the `r epu_abbr`. These proportions are highlighted below in Table \ref{tab:land-rev-props}.

```{r land-rev-props}

knitr::kable(land_rev_prop,
      caption = paste0("Proportion of landings and revenue derived from managed species in the ",region," region. \\label{land-rev-props}"),
      align = 'c',
      booktabs = T) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%

Total commercial seafood landings from all species and from `r council_abbr` managed species in the `r epu_abbr` indicate total seafood production. Years prior to 1977 included foreign landings, so we began the time series in 1986 **Why not 1978?**. Aggregated landings, as shown in Figure \ref{total-landings}, are drawn from domestic fisheries only. In the `r region`, *there has been a significant recent decrease in seafood landings, indicating high risk to regional domestic seafood production* **Specific to MAB**.

Recreational seafood landings (as opposed to total landings that include catch and release shown by other indicators) were used to assess food use of recreationally caught fish in the `r region`. These data are shown in Figure \ref{rec-landings}, *where a negative long-term trend is driven by high catch prior to 1990. Recreational harvest remains near the long-term mean after 1990, and is likely increasing.* **Specific to MAB**

## `Commercial Fishery Revenue (`r epu_abbr`)`

This indicator links the human activity of commercial fishing to the profits objective. The Bennet Indicator, as shown in Figure \ref{bennet}, shows changes in revenue as a composite of price and volume of catch in the `r region`. For example, in the year 2010, the volume of catch relative to the long-term mean was low, and price was relatively high. Combined, these data indicate the "pull" of catch price and volume on revenue changes. Here we show the indicator for all species caught in the `r region`, and a feeding guild level breakdown of these data is available in the Appendix. 

```{r bennet, fig.cap = paste0("Revenue change from the long-term mean in 2015 dollars (black), Price (PI), and Volume Indicators (VI) for commercial landings in the ",region,". \\label{bennet}"), fig.height = 3}

## Ecosystem-wide and Managed Species Total Revenue (`r epu_abbr`)

```


Average total revenue from `r council_abbr` managed species ranges from `r min_rev_perc`-`r max_rev_perc`% of total revenue from commercial fishing in the `r region` region over the last 5 years (Fig. \ref{comm-rev}).

## Commercial Fleet Diversity (coastwide, `r region` permits)

Maintaining diversity can provide the capacity to adapt to change at the ecosystem level for dependent fishing communities, and can address objectives related to stability. Diversity estimates have been developed for fleets and species landed by vessels with `r region` permits (Fig. \ref{comm-div}). A fleet is defined here as the combination of gear code (Scallop Dredge, Other Dredge, Gillnet, Hand Gear, Longline, Bottom Trawl, Midwater Trawl, Pot, Purse Seine, or Clam Dredge) and vessel length category (<30 ft., 30-50 ft., 50 to 75 ft., and >75 ft.). The metric presented assesses the diversity of the overarching fleet, in terms of all revenue generated. 

A declining trend in diversity indicates reliance on either a smaller number of resources, or a less diverse pool of resources. The diversity metric alone cannot distinguish whether specialization (by choice) or stovepiping (choices constrained) is occurring in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem. 


```{r comm-div, fig.width = 5, fig.asp = .7, fig.cap = paste0("Fleet diversity (A) and fleet count (B) in the ",region,". \\label{comm-div}")}

Another diversity index is the average effective Shannon index for species revenue at the permit level (Fig. \ref{spec-div}), for all permits landing any amount of `r council_abbr` FMP species within a year **(including Monkfish and Spiny Dogfish)**. Although the exact value of effective Shannon index is relatively uninformative, the major change in diversity seems to have occurred in the late 1990s, with much of the recent ndex being relatively stable.
