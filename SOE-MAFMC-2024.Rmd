# Introduction

## About This Report

This report is for the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC). The purpose of this report is to synthesize ecosystem information to allow the MAFMC to better meet fishery management objectives, and to update the MAFMC’s Ecosystem Approach to Fishery Management (EAFM) risk assessment. The major messages of the report are synthesized on pages 1 and 2, and synthesis themes are illustrated on page 3. The information in this report is organized into two sections; [performance measured against ecosystem-level management objectives](#performance-relative-to-fishery-management-objectives) (Table \ref{tab:management-objectives}), and potential [risks to meeting fishery management objectives](#risks-to-meeting-fishery-management-objectives) ([climate change](#climate-and-ecosystem-productivity) and [other ocean uses](#other-ocean-uses-offshore-wind)).

## Report structure

The two main sections contain subsections for each management objective or potential risk. Within each subsection, we first review observed trends for indicators representing each objective or risk, including the status of the most recent data year relative to a threshold (if available) or relative to the long-term average. Second, we identify potential drivers of observed trends, and synthesize results of indicators related to those drivers to outline potential implications for management. For example, if there are multiple drivers related to an indicator trend, which drivers may be more or less supported by current information, and which, if any, can be affected by management action(s)? We emphasize that these implications are intended to represent testable hypotheses at present, rather than “answers,” because the science behind these indicators and syntheses continues to develop.

A glossary of terms^[https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/glossary.html], detailed technical methods documentation^[https://NOAA-EDAB.github.io/tech-doc], indicator data^[https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata], and detailed indicator descriptions^[https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/index.html]  are available online. The details of standard figure formatting (Fig. \ref{fig:docformat}a), categorization of fish and invertebrate species into feeding guilds (Table \ref{tab:species-groupings}), and definitions of ecological production units (EPUs, including the Mid-Atlantic Bight, MAB; Fig. \ref{fig:docformat}b) are provided at the end of the document.

# Performance Relative to Fishery Management Objectives

In this section, we examine indicators related to broad, ecosystem-level fishery management objectives. We also provide hypotheses on the implications of these trends—why we are seeing them, what’s driving them, and potential or observed regime shifts or changes in ecosystem structure. Identifying multiple drivers, regime shifts, and potential changes to ecosystem structure, as well as identifying the most vulnerable resources, can help managers determine whether anything differently needs to be done to meet objectives and how to prioritize upcoming issues/risks.

## Seafood Production 

### Indicators: Landings; commercial and recreational 
This year, we present updated [indicators](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/commercial-landings-and-revenue.html) for total commercial landings U.S. seafood landings, and Council-managed U.S. seafood landings. Total commercial landings within the Mid-Atlantic have declined over the long term, and total U.S. Mid-Atlantic seafood landings are near their all time low. Because there is no long term trend in MAFMC-managed U.S. seafood landings, the decline in U.S. seafood landings in the Mid-Atlantic region is likely driven by recent declines in species not managed by the Mid-Atlantic Council (Fig. \ref{fig:total-landings}).

```{r, total-landings, fig.asp=.8, fig.cap = "Total commercial landings (black), total U.S. seafood landings (blue), and Mid-Atlantic managed U.S. seafood landings (red)."}
#code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-comdat-total-landings.R")
ecodata::plot_comdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "landings")
```

Commercial landings by guild include all species and all uses, and are reported as total for the guild and the MAFMC managed species within the [guild](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/feeding-guilds-by-management-bodies.html). As reported in previous years, landings of benthos presented a significant downward trend, primarily driven by surf clam and ocean quahog, with scallops now contributing to the decline as well. However, total landings of planktivores is now also presenting a significant downward trend, primarily due to decreases in species not managed by the MAFMC (Atlantic herring and Atlantic menhaden; Fig. \ref{fig:comm-landings}).

```{r, comm-landings, fig.asp=1.6, fig.cap ="Total commercial landings in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (black) and MAFMC-managed U.S seafood landings (red) by feeding guild."}
#code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-comdat-commercial-landings.R"),

ecodata::plot_comdat(report = "MidAtlantic", plottype = "guild")

```

Although total [recreational harvest](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/recreational-fishing-indicators.html) (retained fish presumed to be eaten) has increased from a historic low in 2018, there is a long-term decline in the MAB (Fig. \ref{fig:rec-landings}). 

```{r, rec-landings, fig.cap ="Total recreational seafood harvest (millions of pounds) in the Mid-Atlantic region."}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recdat-landings.R")

ecodata::plot_recdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName ="landings")
```

[Recreational shark landings](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/highly-migratory-species-landings.html) show an increase in pelagic sharks over the past decade, with a sharp decrease in 2018 - 2019 persisting through 2022 (Fig \ref{fig:rec-hms}). This is likely influenced by regulatory changes implemented in 2018 intended to rebuild shortfin mako stocks. 

```{r rec-hms, fig.cap="Recreational shark landings from Large Pelagics Survey.",  fig.width=5, fig.asp=.35}
#code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-rec_hms.R"),

ecodata::plot_rec_hms(shadedRegion = c(2014,2023), report="MidAtlantic")
```

Aquaculture production is not yet included in total seafood landings. Available [aquaculture production](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/aquaculture-production.html) of oysters for a subset of Mid-Atlantic states indicates a decline in recent years.

### Implications

Declining commercial (total and seafood) and recreational landings can be driven by many interacting factors, including combinations of ecosystem and stock production, management actions, market conditions, and environmental change. While we cannot evaluate all possible drivers at present, here we evaluate the extent to which stock status and system biomass trends may play a role.

#### Stock Status and Catch Limits
Single species [management objectives](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/stock-status.html) (1. maintaining biomass above minimum thresholds and 2. maintaining fishing mortality below overfishing limits) are being met for all but two MAFMC-managed species, though the status of six stocks is unknown (Fig. \ref{fig:stock-status}). 

```{r stock-status, fig.width = 7.5,  fig.asp = 0.5, fig.cap = "Summary of single species status for MAFMC and jointly federally managed stocks (Spiny dogfish and both Goosefish). The dotted vertical line is the target biomass reference point of $B_{MSY}$. The dashed lines are the management thresholds of one half $B_{MSY}$. (vertical) or $F_{MSY}$. (horizontal). Stocks in orange are below the biomass threshold (overfished) or have fishing mortality above the limit (subject to overfishing), so are not meeting objectives. Stocks in purple  are above the biomass threshold but below the biomass target with fishing mortality within the limit. Stocks in green are above the biomass target, with fishing mortality within the limit."}

# code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-stock-status.R"), 

a <- ecodata::plot_stock_status(report = "MidAtlantic")

a$p + ggplot2::coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,2), ylim=c(0,2)) +
  ggplot2::annotation_custom(gridExtra::tableGrob(a$unknown,
                             theme = gridExtra::ttheme_default(base_size = 7), 
                             rows=NULL), 
                             xmin=0.8, xmax=1.8, ymin=1.5, ymax=2)

```

Stock status affects catch limits established by the Council, which in turn may affect landings trends. Summed across all MAFMC managed species, total Acceptable Biological Catch or Annual Catch Limits [(ABC or ACL)](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/abc-or-acl-for-managed-stocks.html) have been relatively stable 2012-2022 (Fig. \ref{fig:abcacl-stacked}). The recent total ABC or ACL is lower relative to 2012-2013, with much of that decrease due to declining Atlantic mackerel ABC. This is true even with the addition of blueline tilefish management in 2017 contributing an additional ABC and ACL to the total 2017-2022, due to that fishery’s small relative size.

```{r abcacl-stacked, fig.cap="Sum of catch limits across all MAFMC managed commercial (C) and recreational (R) fisheries.", fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.4}
#, code =  readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-abcacl-stacked.R")

ecodata::plot_abc_acl(report = "MidAtlantic", plottype = "Stacked")

```

Nevertheless, the percentage caught (landings and discards) for each stock’s ABC/ACL suggests that these catch limits are not generally constraining as most species are well below the 1/1 ratio (Fig. \ref{fig:abcacl-catch}). Therefore, stock status and associated management constraints are unlikely to be driving decreased landings for the majority of species.

```{r abcacl-catch, fig.cap = "Catch divided by ABC/ACL for MAFMC managed fisheries. High points are recreational black sea bass (up to 2021) and scup (2022). Red line indicates the median ratio across all fisheries."}
#, code =  readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-abcacl-catch.R")

ecodata::plot_abc_acl(report = "MidAtlantic", plottype = "Catch")

```

#### System Biomass
Although [aggregate biomass](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/aggregate-survey-biomass.html) trends derived from scientific resource surveys are mostly stable in the MAB, spring piscivores and fall benthivores show long-term increases (Fig. \ref{fig:nefsc-biomass-mab}). While managed species make up varying proportions of aggregate biomass, trends in landings are not mirroring shifts in the overall trophic structure of survey-sampled fish and invertebrates. Therefore, major shifts in feeding guilds or ecosystem trophic structure are unlikely to be driving the decline in landings.
```{r nefsc-biomass-mab, fig.cap = "Spring (left) and fall (right) surveyed biomass in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Data from the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey are shown in black, with the nearshore NEAMAP survey shown in red. The shaded area around each annual mean represents 2 standard deviations from the mean.", fig.width=8, fig.asp = 0.75}

#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-aggregate-biomass.R")

ecodata::plot_aggregate_biomass(report = "MidAtlantic") 

```

#### Effect on Seafood Production
Stock status is above the minimum threshold for all but two stocks, and aggregate biomass trends appear stable, so the decline in managed commercial seafood landings is most likely driven by market dynamics affecting the landings of surfclams and ocean quahogs, as landings have been below quotas for these species. In addition, regional availability of scallops has contributed to the decline of benthos landings not managed by the MAFMC, with some of the most productive grounds currently closed through rotational management. The long term decline in total planktivore landings is largely driven by Atlantic menhaden fishery dynamics, including a consolidation of processors leading to reduced fishing capacity between the 1990s and mid-2000s. 

Climate change also seems to be shifting the distribution of surfclams and ocean quahogs, resulting in areas with overlapping distributions and increased mixed landings. Given the regulations governing mixed landings, this could become problematic in the future and is currently being evaluated by the Council.

The decline in recreational seafood harvest stems from other drivers. Some of the decline, such as that for recreational shark landings, is driven by management intended to reduce fishing mortality on mako sharks. However, NOAA Fisheries’ Marine Recreational Information Program survey methodology was updated in 2018, so it is unclear whether the lower than average landings for species other than sharks since 2018 are driven by changes in fishing behavior or the change in the survey methodology. Nevertheless, the recreational harvest seems to be stabilizing at a lower level than historical estimates.

Other environmental changes require monitoring as they may become important drivers of landings in the future:
 
- Climate is trending into uncharted territory. Globally, 2023 was the warmest year on record (see [2023 Highlights section](#2023-highlights)).   
- Stocks are shifting their distributions, moving towards the northeast and into deeper waters throughout the Northeast US Large Marine Ecosystem (see [Climate Risks section](#climate-and-ecosystem-productivity)).
- Some ecosystem composition and production changes have been observed (see [Stability section](#stability)). 
- Some fishing communities are affected by environmental justice vulnerabilities (see [Environmental Justice and Social Vulnerability section](#social-vulnerability)).  

## Commercial Profits 

### Indicators: revenue (a proxy for profits)  
Total [commercial revenue](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/commercial-landings-and-revenue.html) and MAFMC managed species revenue within the Mid-Atlantic Bight have declined over the past 20-30 years. In 2022, total revenue was at an all-time low, and revenue from MAFMC managed species was near an all-time low (Fig. \ref{fig:comm-revenue}). 
```{r comm-revenue, fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.45, fig.cap = "Revenue for the for the Mid-Atlantic region: total (black) and from MAFMC managed species (red)."}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-comdat-comm-revenue.R")

ecodata::plot_comdat(report="MidAtlantic", varName="revenue") + 
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "right",
                      legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank())

```

Revenue earned by harvesting resources is a function of both the quantity landed of each species and the prices paid for landings. Beyond monitoring yearly changes in revenue, it is even more valuable to determine what drives these changes: harvest levels, the mix of species landed, price changes, or a combination of these. The [Bennet Indicator](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/bennet-indicator.html) decomposes revenue change into two parts, one driven by changing quantities (volumes), and a second driven by changing prices. All changes are in relation to a base year (1982).

In the Mid-Atlantic region revenues were above the 1982 baseline for all years in the series until 2022 (Fig. \ref{fig:bennet}).  Both increasing prices and volumes contributed to the positive revenue change in most years.  In terms of prices, since 2000 Benthos contributed the most to increasing prices (Fig.  \ref{fig:bennet-all}). Beginning in the 1990s, in most years benthivores contributed the most to increasing volumes (Fig.  \ref{fig:bennet-all}). 
```{r bennet, fig.cap = "Revenue change from 1982 values in 2022 dollars (black); Price (PI), and Volume Indicators (VI) for total commercial landings in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.", fig.width=6, fig.asp=.35}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-bennet.R")

ecodata::plot_bennet(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "total")

```

```{r bennet-all, fig.cap = "Total price and volume indicators in 2022 dollars (black) for commercial landings, and individual guild contributions to each indicator, in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.",  fig.width = 7.5, fig.asp = 0.35}
#code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-bennet-all.R"),

ecodata::plot_bennet(report="MidAtlantic") #+ ggplot2::facet_wrap(~Var, ncol=1)
```

### Implications 
Although the Mid-Atlantic region shows declining revenue trends since 2016, inflation-adjusted revenue from harvested species was still greater than 1982 levels until 2022. In a similar manner to seafood landings, the results here are driven in large part by market dynamics affecting the landings of surfclams and ocean quahogs, as landings have been below quotas for these species, as well as lower quotas for Atlantic scallops. The declining Benthos category since 2012 may be partially caused by decreases in surfclam and ocean quahogs in the southern part of their range as harvest have shifted northward. Changes in other indicators, particularly those driving landings and those related to climate change, require monitoring as they may become important drivers of revenue in the future; for example:

-  Surfclams, ocean quahogs, and scallops are sensitive to warming ocean temperatures and ocean acidification.   
-  [Multiple stressors](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/ocean-acidification-and-other-stressors.html) are interacting in Mid-Atlantic shellfish habitats.
  

## Recreational Opportunities 

### Indicators: Angler trips, fleet diversity  
[Recreational effort](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/recreational-fishing-indicators.html) (angler trips) in 2022 has increased and is above the long-term average (Fig. \ref{fig:rec-op}). in the MAB. However, recreational fleet diversity (i.e., effort by shoreside, private boat, and for-hire anglers) has declined over the long term (Fig. \ref{fig:rec-div}). 
```{r rec-op, fig.cap = "Recreational effort in the Mid-Atlantic."}
# code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recdat-effort.R")

ecodata::plot_recdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "effort")
```

```{r rec-div, fig.cap = "Recreational fleet effort diversity in the Mid-Atlantic."}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recdat-diversity.R")

ecodata::plot_recdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "effortdiversity")
```

### Implications
While the overall number of recreational opportunities in the MAB is above the long-term average, the continuing decline in recreational fleet effort diversity suggests a potentially reduced range of recreational fishing options, despite the slight increase in this indicator’s value between 2020 and 2022.

The downward effort diversity trend is driven by party/charter contraction (down from 2% in 2021 to 1.4% in 2023), and a shift toward shorebased angling, which currently makes up 59% of angler trips. Effort in private boats has increased slightly to 40% of trips from 37% in 2021.

Changes in recreational fleet diversity can be considered when managers seek options to maintain recreational opportunities. Shore anglers will have access to different species than vessel-based anglers, and when the same species is accessible both from shore and from a vessel, shore anglers typically have access to smaller individuals. Many states have developed shore-based regulations where the minimum size is lower than in other areas and sectors to maintain opportunities in the shore angling sector.


## Stability 

### Indicators: fishery fleet and catch diversity, ecological component diversity 
While there are many potential metrics of stability, we use diversity indices to evaluate overall stability in fisheries and ecosystems. In general, diversity that remains constant over time suggests a similar capacity to respond to change over time. A significant change in diversity over time does not necessarily indicate a problem or an improvement, but does indicate a need for further investigation. We examine diversity in commercial fleet and species catch, recreational species catch (with fleet effort diversity discussed above), zooplankton, and adult fishes.

#### Fishery Stability 
[Diversity](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/commercial-catch-and-fleet-diversity.html)  estimates have been developed for fleets landing managed species, and species landed by commercial vessels with Mid-Atlantic permits. Commercial fishery fleet count and fleet diversity have been stable over time in the MAB, with current values near the long-term average. This indicates similar commercial fleet composition and species targeting opportunities over time. Commercial fisheries are relying on fewer species relative to the mid-90s, although current species revenue diversity has recovered somewhat in the last year (Fig. \ref{fig:commercial-div-species-div}). 

```{r commercial-div-species-div,  fig.cap = paste0("Species revenue diversity in the Mid Atlantic.")}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-commercial-div-species-div.R")

ecodata::plot_commercial_div(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "Permit revenue species diversity")
```

As noted [above](#recreational-opportunities), [recreational fleet effort diversity](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/recreational-fishing-indicators.html) is declining (Fig. \ref{fig:rec-div}), suggesting a shift in recreational fishing opportunities. However, recreational species catch diversity has no long term trend so is considered stable, and has been at or above the long term average in 8 of the last 10 years (Fig. \ref{fig:recdat-div-catch}). 

```{r recdat-div-catch, fig.cap = paste0("Diversity of recreational catch in the Mid Atlantic.")}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recdat-div-catch.R")

ecodata::plot_recdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "catchdiversity")
```

#### Ecological Stability

Total [primary production](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/phytoplankton-chlorophyll-size-class-and-primary-production.html) (PP) is a measure of the total energy input into a system per year. Total primary production in the Mid Atlantic has no clear trend, suggesting stability in energy at the base of the food web. 

```{r totpp, fig.cap="Total areal annual primary production for the MAB. The dashed line represents the long-term (1998-2023) annual mean."}

ecodata::plot_annual_chl_pp(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "pp", plottype = "total")
```

Ecological diversity indices show mixed trends. [Zooplankton diversity](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/zooplankton-diversity.html) is increasing in the MAB (Fig. \ref{fig:zoo-diversity}). [Adult fish diversity](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/expected-number-of-species.html) is measured as the expected number of species in a standard number of individuals sampled from the NEFSC bottom trawl survey. Adult fish diversity indices appear stable over time, with current values within one standard deviation from most historic estimates (Fig. \ref{fig:exp-n}).

### Implications
Fleet diversity indices are used by the MAFMC to evaluate stability objectives as well as risks to fishery resilience and maintaining equity in access to fishery resources. Stability in commercial fleet diversity metrics suggests stable capacity to respond to the current range of fishing opportunities. However, commercial species diversity remains low when compared to historical levels.

Declining recreational fleet effort diversity, as noted above, indicates that the party/charter boat sector continues to contract, with shoreside angling becoming more important as a percentage of recreational angler trips. Stability in recreational species catch diversity has been maintained by a different set of species over time. A recent increase in Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) managed species in recreational catch is helping to maintain diversity in the same range that MAFMC and New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) managed species supported in the 1990s.

Production at the base of the food web is variable, but stable over time. Ecological diversity indices can provide insight into ecosystem structure. Changes in ecological diversity over time may indicate altered ecosystem structure with implications for fishery productivity and management. Stable adult fish diversity indicates the same overall number and evenness over time, but doesn’t rule out species substitutions (e.g., warm-water replacing cold-water). In addition, the change in survey vessels complicates interpretation of long-term fish diversity trends.

In the MAB, existing diversity indicators suggest overall stability in the fisheries and ecosystem components examined. However, declining recreational fleet diversity suggests a potential loss in the range of recreational fishing opportunities. Increasing zooplankton diversity (due to increases in abundance of several taxa and stable or declining dominance of an important copepod species) suggests a shift in the zooplankton community that warrants continued monitoring to determine if managed species are affected. In addition, the species diversity in commercial landings warrants continued attention given its relatively low index value indicating average reliance on a small number of species for revenue.

## Environmental Justice and Social Vulnerability 

**A data error was found immediately prior to submission to internal review, therefore this section is preliminary, subject to change, and will be updated ASAP.**

### Indicators: Environmental Justice and Social Vulnerability in commercial and recreational fishing communities

Social vulnerability measures social factors that shape a community’s ability to adapt to change. A subset of these factors can be used to assess potential environmental justice issues. We report the top ten communities most engaged in, and/or reliant upon, commercial and recreational fisheries and the degree to which these communities may be vulnerable to environmental justice issues (i.e., Poverty, Population Composition, and Personal Disruption) based on 2021 data. The engagement and reliance indices demonstrate the importance of commercial and recreational fishing to a given community relative to other coastal communities in a region. Similarly, the environmental justice indices characterize different facets and levels of social vulnerability in a given community relative to other coastal communities in a region. 

*Data error found for Reedville, VA. The following sentence and plot are likely to change when corrected*

*Changes in fishing activity between years changed community engagement and reliance rankings, and changes in vulnerability indicators changed environmental justice vulnerability scores.  The largest change from last year’s report is that Reedville, VA and  Hatteras, and Hobucken, NC are no longer listed as top ten commercial fishing communities, replaced by Hampton, VA; Swan Quarter, NC; Bowers and Little Creek, DE (Fig.\ref{fig:commercial-engagement}). *

Manteo, Vandemere, and Hobuken, NC are no longer listed as top ten recreational communities, replaced by Cape May and Barnegat Light, NJ; Orient, NY; Topsail Beach, Avon and Rodanthe, NC (Fig.\ref{fig:recreational-engagement}).

Scores for environmental justice concerns remain similar for communities based on 2020 and 2021 data, with top commercial ports (Fig. \ref{fig:commercial-EJ}) showing more concerns than top recreational ports overall (Fig. \ref{fig:recreational-EJ}).  Atlantic City, NJ ranks highest for all three environmental justice concerns. There is variability in the specific issues facing communities with environmental justice concerns.  Higher scores in population composition indicate community vulnerability related to the presence of non-white, non-English speaking, and younger populations.

Both commercial and recreational fishing are important activities in Montauk, NY, Cape May, Barnegat Light and Point Pleasant Beach, NJ; and Rodanthe, NC, meaning these communities may be impacted simultaneously by commercial and recreational regulatory changes. However, in all but Point Pleasant Beach NJ,  environmental justice may not be a major concern in these communities given the index scores (Figs \ref{fig:commercial-EJ} and \ref{fig:recreational-EJ})). Point Pleasant Beach, NJ scored medium for the personal disruption index, indicating that environmental justice may  be a moderate concern in Point Pleasant Beach.


### Implications
A range of environmental justice concerns are found throughout Mid-Atlantic fishing communities. However, index scores for these concerns are higher overall in the top commercial communities relative to the top recreational communities. 

These indicators provide a snapshot of the presence of environmental justice issues in the most highly engaged and most highly reliant commercial and recreational fishing communities in the Mid-Atlantic. These communities may be especially vulnerable to changes in fishing patterns due to regulations and/or climate change. Some changes occurred among the top fishing communities due to shifts in fishing activities, both commercial and recreational. Many of these communities, especially top commercial fishing communities, demonstrated medium to high environmental justice vulnerability, indicating that they may be at a disadvantage when responding to change.


## Protected Species
Fishery management objectives for protected species generally focus on reducing threats and on habitat conservation/restoration. Protected species include marine mammals protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, endangered and threatened species protected under the Endangered Species Act, and migratory birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In the Northeast U.S., endangered/threatened species include Atlantic salmon, Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, all sea turtle species, and five baleen whales. Here we report on the status of these actions as well as indicating the potential for future interactions driven by observed and predicted ecosystem changes in the Northeast U.S. Protected species objectives include managing bycatch to remain below potential biological removal (PBR) thresholds, recovering endangered populations, and monitoring unusual mortality events (UMEs).

### Indicators: bycatch, population (adult and juvenile) numbers, mortalities
Average indices for both harbor porpoise (Fig. \ref{fig:harborporpoise}) and gray seal bycatch (Fig. \ref{fig:grayseal}) are below current PBR thresholds, meeting management objectives. 
```{r harborporpoise, fig.cap="Harbor porpoise average bycatch estimate for Mid-Atlantic and New England gillnet fisheries (blue) and the potential biological removal (red).",, fig.width=5}
# code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-harborporpoise.R")
#fig.width=6}

ecodata::plot_harborporpoise()
```

The annual estimate for gray seal bycatch has declined since 2019, in part driven by declining gillnet landings. In addition, estimates since 2019 have greater uncertainty stemming from low observer coverage since 2019. The rolling mean confidence interval remains just below the PBR threshold.
```{r grayseal, fig.cap="Gray Seal average bycatch estimate for gillnet fisheries (blue) and and the potential biological removal (red).", fig.width=5}

```

The North Atlantic right whale population was on a recovery trajectory until 2010, but has since declined (Fig. \ref{fig:narw-abundance}). The sharp decline observed from 2015-2020 appears to have slowed, although the right whale population continues to experience annual mortalities above recovery thresholds. Reduced survival rates of adult females lead to diverging abundance trends between sexes. It is estimated that there are fewer than 70 adult females remaining in the population.  
```{r narw-abundance, fig.cap = "Estimated North Atlanic right whale abundance on the Northeast Shelf."}
#code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-narw-abundance.R")

ecodata::plot_narw(varName = "adult")
```
North Atlantic right whale calf counts have generally declined after 2009 to the point of having zero new calves observed in 2018 (Fig. \ref{fig:NARW-calf-abundance}). However, since 2019, we have seen more calf births each year with 15 births in 2022.
```{r NARW-calf-abundance, fig.cap = "Number of North Atlantic right whale calf births, 1990 - 2022."}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-NARW-calf-abundance.R")

ecodata::plot_narw(varName = "calf")
```

This year, the Unusual Mortality Event (UME) for North Atlantic right whales continued. Since 2017, the total UME right whale mortalities includes 36 dead stranded whales, 15 in the US and 21 in Canada. When alive but seriously injured whales (35) and sublethal injuries or ill whales (51) are taken into account, 122 individual whales are included in the UME. Recent research suggests that many mortalities go unobserved and the true number of mortalities are about three times the count of the observed mortalities. The primary cause of death is “human interaction” from entanglements or vessel strikes.

A UME continued from previous years for humpback whales (2016-present); suspected causes include human interactions.  A UME for minke whales that began in 2017 remains open, but is pending closure as of January 2024.

### Implications
Bycatch management measures have been implemented to maintain bycatch below PBR thresholds. The downward trend in harbor porpoise bycatch could also be due to a decrease in harbor porpoise abundance in U.S. waters, reducing their overlap with fisheries, and a decrease in gillnet effort. The increasing trend in gray seal bycatch may be related to an increase in the gray seal population (U.S. pup counts), supported by the dramatic rise over the last three decades in observed numbers of gray seal pups born at U.S. breeding sites plus an increase in adult seals at the breeding sites, some of which are supplemented by Canadian adults. 

Strong evidence exists to suggest that interactions between right whales and both the fixed gear fisheries in the U.S. and Canada and vessel strikes in the U.S. are contributing substantially to the decline of the species. Further, right whale distribution has changed since 2010. New research suggests that recent climate driven changes in ocean circulation have resulted in right whale distribution changes driven by increased warm water influx through the Northeast Channel, which has reduced the primary right whale prey (the copepod Calanus finmarchicus) in the central and eastern portions of the Gulf of Maine. Additional potential stressors include offshore wind development, which overlaps with important habitat areas used year-round by right whales, including mother and calf migration corridors and foraging habitat. This area is also the only known right whale winter foraging habitat. Additional information can be found in the  [offshore wind risks section](#other-ocean-uses-offshore-wind).

The UMEs are under investigation and are likely the result of multiple drivers. For all large whale UMEs, human interaction appears to have contributed to increased mortalities, although investigations are not complete.

A climate vulnerability assessment is published  for Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico marine mammal populations.


# Risks to meeting fishery management objectives

## Climate and Ecosystem Change

Regulations and measures designed to meet fishery management objectives are often based on historical information about stocks: their distribution in space and time, and their overall productivity. Large scale climate related changes in the ecosystem can lead to changes in important habitats and ecological interactions, altering distributions and productivity. With large enough ecosystem changes, management measures may be less effective, and management objectives may not be met. 

This year, we have restructured this section to focus on three categories of management decisions and the risk posed to them by climate and ecosystem change: spatial management, seasonal management, and quota setting or rebuilding depleted stocks. In each section, we highlight observed changes in distribution, timing, and productivity of fish and protected species. Then, we review possible drivers for these observed changes, in order to determine how management might be adjusted to account for the observed changes. Finally, we provide an overview of notable climate and ecosystem observations from 2023.  

### Risks to Spatial Management

Shifting species distributions alter both species interactions and fishery interactions. In particular, shifting species distributions can alter expected management outcomes from spatial allocations and bycatch measures based on historical fish and protected species distributions. Species availability to surveys can change as distributions shift within survey footprints.

#### Observations: Fish and protected species distribution shifts
As noted in the [Landings Implications section above](#implications), trends for a suite of 48 commercially or ecologically important fish species along the entire Northeast Shelf continue to show movement towards the northeast and generally into deeper water (Fig. \ref{fig:species-dist}). 
  
```{r species-dist, fig.cap = "Aggregate species distribution metrics for species in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem.", fig.asp=.9}

#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-species-dist.R")

a <- ecodata::plot_species_dist(varName = "along") + ggplot2::coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE)
b <- ecodata::plot_species_dist(varName = "depth") + ggplot2::coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) 

a/b
```  

Habitat model-based species richness suggests shifts of both cooler and warmer water species to the northeast [*link to catalog page*]. Similar patterns have been found for marine mammals, with multiple species shifting northeast between 2010 and 2017 in most seasons (Fig. \ref{fig:protectedspp-dist-shifts}, @chavez-rosales_detection_2022).

```{r protectedspp-dist-shifts, fig.cap="Direction and magnitude of core habitat shifts, represented by the length of the line of the seasonal weighted centroid for species with more than 70 km difference between 2010 and 2017 (tip of arrow).", fig.width=7, fig.asp=0.8}

ecodata::plot_HMS_species_distribution() + ggplot2::ggtitle("Whale and Dolphin Distribution Shifts")
```


#### Drivers: 

Increasing temperature, changing oceanography, and the decreasing size of the seasonal cold pool can alter the spatial distribution of suitable habitat for managed species, as well as availability and distribution of their prey. 

Ocean temperatures continue to warm at both the surface (Fig. \ref{fig:seasonal-oisst-anom}) and bottom (Fig. \ref{fig:bottom-temp}) throughout the Mid-Atlantic in all seasons.

```{r seasonal-oisst-anom, fig.cap="MAB (grey outline) seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) time series . Seasons are defined as: Jan-Mar for winter, Apr-Jun for spring, Jul-Sep for summer, and Oct-Dec for fall.", fig.width = 6, fig.asp = .6}

Variability of the Gulf Stream is one of the major drivers of changes in the oceanographic conditions of the Northeast U.S. continental shelf. During the last decade, the Gulf Stream has become less stable and shifted northward (Fig. \ref{fig:GSI}).  A more northern Gulf Stream position is associated with warmer ocean temperature on the northeast shelf [@zhang_role_2007], a higher proportion of Warm Slope Water in the Northeast Channel, and increased sea surface height along the U.S. east coast [@goddard_extreme_2015]. 

```{r GSI, fig.cap = "Index representing changes in the location of the Gulf Stream north wall. Positive values represent a more northerly Gulf Stream position."}

ecodata::plot_gsi()
```


Changes in ocean temperature and circulation alter habitat features such as the seasonal cold pool, a 20–60 m thick band of cold, relatively uniform near-bottom water that persists from spring to fall over the mid and outer shelf of the MAB and southern flank of Georges Bank [@lentz_seasonal_2017; @chen_seasonal_2018]. The cold pool plays an essential role in the structuring of the MAB ecosystem. It is a reservoir of nutrients that feeds phytoplankton productivity, is essential fish spawning and nursery habitat, and affects fish distribution and behavior [@lentz_seasonal_2017; @miles_offshore_2021]. The average temperature of the cold pool is getting warmer over time [@miller_state-space_2016; @du_pontavice_incorporating_nodate], and the area is getting smaller [@friedland_middle_2022] (Fig. \ref{fig:cold-pool-size}).

```{r cold-pool-size, fig.cap="Seasonal cold pool indices: mean temperature within the cold pool, cold pool persistence, and spatial extent.", fig.width = 5, fig.asp=.5, results='hide'}
#,  code=readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_MAB.Rmd-cold_pool.R")

```

Changes in the distribution of forage biomass affects predator distribution. Spatial subsets of the forage fish index were included in the bluefish research track stock assessment to investigate forage-driven changes in bluefish availability to recreational fisheries and surveys.

### Risks to Seasonal Management

Changes in seasonal life-cycle events may not align with fishing seasons or area opening/closing, potentially reducing effectiveness of management measures. Temporal changes in species/fishery overlap can alter bycatch, and availability to surveys can change. 

#### Observations: Timing shifts

Seasonal timing of spawning has changed for several managed fish species. Migration timing of some tunas and large whales has changed.

GENERATE A FIGURE

#### Drivers: 

Later transition to fall conditions, shorter duration of seasonal cold pool, changing timing of fall phytoplankton blooms, seasonal community shifts in zooplankton, and changes in timing of food availability contribute to changes in species timing. 

In addition to increasing temperatures overall, ocean summer conditions now last longer within each year. In the MAB, the transition date from warm stratified summer conditions to well mixed cool fall conditions is getting later (Fig. \ref{fig:transition}).

```{r transition, fig.cap="Ocean summer length in the MAB: the annual total number of days between the spring thermal transition date and the fall thermal transition date.  The transition dates are defined as the day of the year when surface temperatures changeover from cool to warm conditions in the spring and back to cool conditions in the fall."}

Cold pool timing has changed in the Mid-Atlantic, with the feature persisting for a shorter portion of the year since the mid-2000s (Fig. \ref{fig:cold-pool-time}).

```{r cold-pool-time, fig.cap="Seasonal cold pool indices: mean temperature within the cold pool, cold pool persistence, and spatial extent.", fig.asp=.5, results='hide'}

```

### Risks to Quota Setting/Rebuilding

Environmentally driven changes in growth, reproduction, and natural mortality can complicate short-term stock projections. Stock reference points may not reflect prevailing environmental conditions.

#### Observations: Fish productivity and condition shifts
We describe patterns of aggregate fish productivity in the Mid-Atlantic with the small fish per large fish anomaly indicator, derived from NEFSC bottom trawl survey data (Fig. \ref{fig:productivity-anomaly}). The indicator shows that productivity has been declining in this region since the early 2000s.  A similar analysis based on stock assessment model outputs (recruitment per spawning stock biomass anomaly) for stocks primarily inhabiting the Mid-Atlantic region also shows a decline in productivity. 

```{r productivity-anomaly, fig.cap = "Fish productivity measures. Left: Small fish per large fish survey biomass anomaly in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Right: assessment recruitment per spawning stock biomass anomaly for stocks mainly in the Mid-Atlantic. The summed anomaly across species is shown by the black line, drawn across all years with the same number of stocks analyzed.", fig.width=8, fig.asp=1}
#out.width='49%', fig.show='hold',
a <- ecodata::plot_productivity_anomaly(report = "MidAtlantic") + 
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "bottom",
                      legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank())

b <- ecodata::plot_productivity_anomaly(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "assessment")+ 
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "bottom",
                      legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank())

a + b

```

The health and well being of individual fish can determine population productivity. Heavier and fatter fish at a given length have higher relative condition (the ratio of observed weight to predicted weight based on length [@le_cren_length-weight_1951]) which is expected to improve growth, reproductive output, and survival. A pattern of generally good condition was observed across many MAB species prior to 2000, followed by a period of generally poor condition from 2001-2010 (concurrent with declines in productivity, Fig. \ref{fig:productivity-anomaly}), with a mix of good and poor condition since 2011. Condition was again mixed in 2023, but many species improved in condition from the relatively low condition year in 2021 (Fig. \ref{fig:mab-cf}). Preliminary results of synthetic analyses show that changes in temperature, zooplankton, fishing pressure, and population size influence the condition of different fish species.

```{r mab-cf, fig.cap = "Condition factor for fish species in the MAB based on fall NEFSC bottom trawl survey data. MAB data are missing for 2017 due to survey delays, and no survey was conducted in 2020.", fig.width=8}

ecodata::plot_condition()
```

#### Drivers: 

Fish productivity and condition are affected by increasing metabolic demands from increasing temperature, combined with changes in the availability and quality of prey. Episodic extreme temperatures, ocean acidification, and low oxygen events represent multiple stressors that can affect growth rates and cause mortality.

##### Forage quality and abundance
The amount of forage fish available in the ecosystem combined with the energy content of the forage species determines the amount of energy potentially available to predators in the ecosystem. Changes in the forage base can drive to managed and protected species production. 

Nutritional value (energy content) of juvenile and adult forage fish as prey is related to environmental conditions, fish growth, and reproductive cycles. Forage energy density measurements from NEFSC trawl surveys 2017-2022 are building toward a time series to evaluate trends (Fig. \ref{fig:energy-density}). Data from the fall 2021 and spring 2022 survey measurements were consistent with previous reports: the energy density of Atlantic herring increased to over 7 kJ/g wet weight, but was still well below that observed in the 1980s and 1990s (10.6-9.4 kJ/ g wet weight). Silver hake, longfin squid (*Loligo* in figure) and shortfin squid (*Illex* in figure) remain lower than previous estimates [@steimle_energy_1985; @lawson_important_1998]. Energy density of alewife, butterfish, sand lance, and Atlantic mackerel varies seasonally, with seasonal estimates both higher and lower than estimates from previous decades.  
```{r energy-density, fig.cap="Forage fish energy density mean and standard deviation by season and year, compared with 1980s (solid line; Steimle and Terranove 1985) and 1990s (dashed line; Lawson et al. 1998) values.",  fig.width = 7.5, fig.asp = 0.5}

ecodata::plot_energy_density()
```

A spatially-explicit forage index estimated the combined biomass of 20 forage species using stomach contents information from 22 predatory fish species collected on bottom trawl surveys. The resulting indices for the Mid-Atlantic show a declining long term trend in fall the Mid-Atlantic, and overall higher forage fish in fall relative to spring (Fig. \ref{fig:foragebio}), with highest forage biomass during fall in the early-1980s.   
```{r foragebio, fig.cap = "Forage fish index based on spring and fall survey predator diets.", fig.asp=.6}
#, code=readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-forage-index.R")

ecodata::plot_forage_index()
```

*This is where we would put in overall zooplankton production as well as comments on zoop energy content. We have neither in the Mid. Talk about Cal fin availability in New England*

Phytoplankton support the food web as the primary food source for zooplankton and filter feeders such as shellfish. Numerous environmental and oceanographic factors interact to drive the abundance, composition, spatial distribution, and productivity of phytoplankton.

While changes in fish productivity could result from changing primary productivity, total primary production in the Mid Atlantic has no clear trend.

Temperature increases at both the surface (Fig. \ref{fig:seasonal-oisst_anom}) and bottom (Fig. \ref{fig:bottom-temp}) can exceed thermal tolerance limits for some fish. For example, 2015 had the warmest summer and fall bottom temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic. A large proportion of the region had bottom temperatures above the thermal tolerance for groundfish... with some days exceeding the mortality limit (Fig. \ref{fig:therm-hab-persist-2015}).

Ocean acidification (OA) has caused measured declines in global ocean pH, and is projected to continue declining if high carbon dioxide emissions continue [@intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_ipcc_technical_2022]. OA also changes the availability of minerals required by organisms to form calcified structures such as shells. Calcifying conditions in seawater can be determined by measuring aragonite saturation state ($\Omega_{Arag}$), the tendency of a common type of calcium carbonate, aragonite, to form or dissolve. When $\Omega_{Arag}$ is less than 1, shells and other calcium carbonate structures begin to dissolve. Typical surface ocean $\Omega_{Arag}$ is 2-4, but extremes can be <1 or >5 [@jiang_climatological_2015]. As the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide, both pH and $\Omega_{Arag}$ decrease and can cause organisms to respond with reduced survival, calcification rates, growth, and reproduction, as well as impaired development, and/or changes in energy allocation [@kroeker_impacts_2013 @saba_recommended_2019]. However, sensitivity levels vary, and some organisms exhibit negative responses to calcification and other processes when $\Omega_{Arag}$ is as low as 3.

*OLD TEXT REWRITE FOR NEW FIGURES*
Summer-time (2007-present) $\Omega_{Arag}$ on the U.S. Northeast Shelf varies in space and time, ranging from 0.64 to 2.49 (Fig. \ref{fig:mab-oa}, left panel). Spatially, the lowest bottom $\Omega_{Arag}$ has occurred in the Gulf of Maine, western Long Island Sound, nearshore to mid-shelf waters of the Mid-Atlantic Bight off the coast of New Jersey, and in waters > 1000 meters. $\Omega_{Arag}$ was at or below the sensitivity levels for both Atlantic sea scallop [@cameron_effects_2022] and longfin squid [@zakroff_dose-dependence_2019; @zakroff_antagonistic_2020] in Long Island Sound and the nearshore and mid-shelf regions of the New Jersey shelf (Fig. \ref{fig:mab-oa}, right panels). The sensitivity levels of bottom $\Omega_{Arag}$ occurred during August 2016, July 2018, and August 2019 for both species, and additionally in August 2021 for the Atlantic sea scallop.

### Current status: 2023 overview

Multiple anomalous conditions and extreme events were observed in 2023 that could have brief local effects and/or widespread long-term ecosystem, fishery and management implications. Reported observations should be noted and taken into consideration for future analyses and assessments.

Globally, 2023 was the warmest year on record with record high global sea surface temperatures. North Atlantic surface temperatures were also the highest on record, however temperatures in the Northeast U.S. shelf ecosystem were more variable, near record highs in winter and near average in other seasons. Chesapeake Bay rarely exceeded temperature thresholds.

Bottom temperatures likely thresholds of X and Y degrees for N days in 2023, especially along the Mid-Atlantic coast. *which species care?*

```

The 2020-2022 La Niña conditions ended in late winter and shifted to strong El Niño conditions in late spring 2023.  The current El Niño is expected to gradually weaken and transition to neutral conditions in spring 2024.  During El Niño winters, there is a noted increased frequency of East Coast storms. *add potential implications for fisheries*

Fall tropical and coastal storms caused several flash flood events, above average coastal water levels, strong winds and high rainfall totals throughout the Northeast. *add potential implications for fisheries*

Gulf Stream instability resulted in variability throughout the year. In the fall, the Gulf Stream was in a northward position along the Mid-Atlantic shelf break for an extended period of time. This severely constricted the Slope Sea waters that are normally between the Gulf Stream and continental shelf break. Warm salty surface Gulf Stream waters with strong currents were observed on the continental shelf in the southern MAB in October. *add potential implications for fisheries*

The number of warm core rings (18) was well below the current regime (2000-2022) average of 31. One large early season ring was observed along the Northeast Shelf Break in spring, which generated an anomalously large shelf streamer that pulled continental shelf water into the Slope Sea.  *add potential implications for fisheries*

High abundances of large baleen whale species (North Atlantic rRight wWhales and , humpback whales, minke, (others)) were observed feeding near a warm core rings that wereas adjacent to the continental shelf break in spring.
Summer bottom temperatures in the Gulf of Maine were the warmest on record (since 1993) and the second largest bottom marine heatwave occurred from FebruaryMarch to August, peaked in May, and likely continued into the fall (pending data update). 

Record high (since 1998) chlorophyll concentrations were up to ten times greater than average during a wide-spread, long-duration phytoplankton bloom in the Gulf of Maine that extended onto Georges Bank and the northern Mid-Atlantic Bight (Fig. \ref{fig:chl-current-year}). 

*add potential implications for fisheries: such as:*

A large phytoplankton bloom could represent either an influx of energy into the system, boosting productivity of zooplankton or higher trophic levels, or a settling of unconsumed dead phytoplankton cells to the bottom, where low oxygen could result due to increased bacterial activity consuming the settled material, or both.

NEITHER HAPPENED

It wasn't the typical bloom species.

This species wasn't consumed so we don't expect it to boost fish productivity

This species didn't sink to the bottom so we didn't get low oxygen

Documented die off of scallops in the Mid-Atlantic Elephant trunk regions between the 2022 and 2023 surveys. 
A fish and shellfish mortality event was observed in coastal New Jersey linked to hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) and ocean acidification.

In Chesapeake Bay, hypoxia conditions were the lowest on record (since 1995), creating more suitable habitat for adult and juvenile striped bass.


### Implications

## Other Ocean Uses: Offshore Wind

### Indicators: development timeline, revenue in lease areas, coastal community vulnerability
As of January 2023, 31 offshore wind development projects are proposed for construction over the next decade in the Northeast (timelines and project data are based on Tables E-2, E-4, and E-4-2 of South Fork Wind Farm Final Environmental Impact Statement). Offshore wind areas are anticipated to cover 2.4 million acres by 2030 in the Greater Atlantic region (Fig. \ref{fig:wind-proposed-dev}). Beyond 2030 values include acreage for future areas in the Central Atlantic and Gulf of Maine Area planning area for floating research array.

Just over 3,400 foundations and more than 9,000 miles of inter-array and offshore export cables are proposed to date. The colored chart in Fig. \ref{fig:wind-dev-cumul} also presents the offshore wind development timeline in the Greater Atlantic region with the estimated year that foundations would be constructed (matches the color of the wind areas). These timelines and data estimates are expected to shift but represent the most recent information available as of January 2023. Based on current timelines, the areas affected would be spread out such that it is unlikely that any one particular area would experience full development at one time. Future wind development areas are also presented. Additional call areas, which may eventually become lease areas, totalling over 488,000 acres in the Central Atlantic^[https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/images/draft_wea_primary_secondary3.jpg] may be identified for BOEM’s anticipated 2023 lease sale. It’s anticipated that the Central Atlantic leases will fulfill outstanding offshore wind energy production goals for VA and NC. 

Based on federal vessel logbook data, commercial fishery revenue from trips in the current offshore wind lease areas and the draft Central Atlantic Bight Primary and Secondary Call Areas have varied annually from 2008-2021, with less than \$1 million in revenue overlapping with these areas for most fisheries. However, some fisheries see periodic spikes in revenue overlap with wind energy lease areas, including up to \$4.7 million affected in the surfclam fishery and nearly $4.3 million affected in the longfin squid fishery in 2008 and 2016, respectively.(Fig. \ref{fig:wea-spp-rev}). 

```{r wea-spp-rev, fig.cap="Fishery revenue in wind energy lease areas in the Mid-Atlantic.",  fig.width=5, fig.asp=.4}

```

Of MAFMC-managed fisheries, the chub mackerel fishery could be the fishery most affected by offshore wind development, with a maximum of 17% of annual regional fishery revenue occurring within potential wind lease areas and the Central Atlantic draft call areas during this period, followed by the surfclam (16%), black sea bass (15%), ocean quahog (13%), and blueline tilefish fisheries (10%). The spiny dogfish fishery was the least affected, at 3% maximum annual revenue affected, while 5% of annual revenues were affected for several others (bluefish, butterfish, and summer flounder).  A maximum of 10% of the annual longfin squid revenues were affected by these areas, with similar effects for the scup (9%), Atlantic mackerel (8%), monkfish (7%) and golden tilefish (6%) fisheries (see Table \ref{tab:wea-landings-rev}). While up to 14% of annual *Illex* squid revenue overlapped with offshore wind areas, this is likely overestimated due to the precision of logbook data when compared to vessel monitoring system data (see Table \ref{tab:wea-landings-rev}).

Proposed wind development areas interact with the region’s federal scientific surveys. Scientific surveys are impacted by offshore wind in four ways: 1. Exclusion of NOAA Fisheries’ sampling platforms from the wind development area due to operational and safety limitations; 2.Impacts on the random-stratified statistical design that is the basis for scientific assessments, advice, and analyses; 3.Alteration of benthic and pelagic habitats, and airspace in and around the wind energy development, requiring new designs and methods to sample new habitats; and, 4.Reduced sampling productivity through navigation impacts of wind energy infrastructure on aerial and vessel survey operations. Increase vessel transit between stations may decrease data collections that are already limited by annual days-at-sea day allocations. The total survey area overlap ranges from 1-14% for all Greater Atlantic federal surveys. Individual survey strata have significant interaction with wind, including the sea scallop survey (up to 96% of individual strata) and the bottom trawl survey  (BTS, up to 60% strata overlap). Additionally, up to 50% of the southern New England North Atlantic right whale survey’s area overlaps with proposed project areas. A region-wide survey mitigation program is underway [@northeast_fisheries_science_center_us_noaa_2022]. 

Equity and environmental justice (EJ) are priority concerns with offshore wind development and fisheries impacts in the Northeast. Fig. \ref{fig:wea-port-rev} links historic port revenue (2008-2021) from within all wind lease areas as a proportion of the port’s total revenue based on vessel trip reports as described in the revenue and landings of species in the wind indicator above. The range (minimum and maximum) of total percent revenue from within wind energy areas is presented in the graph and Mid-Atlantic ports are sorted from greatest to least revenue from within wind areas. 

For example, Atlantic City, NJ had a minimum of 11% and maximum of 30% overlap of fisheries revenue in potential wind development areas to the total port fisheries revenue between 2008-2021. Those communities that score Med-High or higher in at least one of the vulnerability indicators that address environmental justice concerns (i.e., Poverty, Population Composition, Personal Disruption; see indicator definitions) are noted with a triangle. Gentrification pressure is also highlighted here, with those communities that score Med-High or higher in one or more gentrification pressure indicators (i.e., Housing Disruption, Retiree Migration, Urban Sprawl) represented with a circle (Fig. \ref{fig:wea-port-rev}). BOEM reports that cumulative offshore wind development (if all proposed projects are developed) could have moderate impacts on low-income members of environmental justice communities who work in the commercial fishing and for-hire fishing industry due to disruptions to fish populations, restrictions on navigation and increased vessel traffic, as well as existing vulnerabilities of low-income workers to economic impacts [@boem_vineyard_2020].

Some ports in New England land Mid-Atlantic managed species from wind areas as well. For the maximum percent value reported in each New England port, the majority (at least 50% based on both value and pounds) of those landings were Mid-Atlantic managed species within wind areas for Barnstable, MA, Boston, MA, Hyannis, MA, North Kingstown/Davisville, RI, and Point Judith, RI. Woods Hole, MA would be added to this list based on pounds only, but did not exceed 50% of value from Mid-Atlantic managed species within wind areas.

Top fishing communities high in environmental justice concerns (i.e., Atlantic City, NJ, Newport News, VA, Hobucken and Beaufort, NC) should be considered in decision making to reduce the social and economic impacts and aid in the resilience and adaptive capacity of underserved communities. It also highlights communities where we need to provide further resources to reach underserved and underrepresented groups and create opportunities for and directly involve these groups in the decision-making process. 

### Implications
Current plans for rapid buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region (Fig. \ref{fig:wind-dev-cumul}).  

Up to 17% of maximum annual fisheries revenue for major Mid-Atlantic commercial species in lease areas and draft call areas could be forgone or reduced and associated effort displaced if all sites are developed. Displaced fishing effort can alter historic fishing area, timing, and method patterns, which can in turn change habitat, species (managed and protected), and fleet interactions. Several factors, including fishery regulations, fishery availability, and user conflicts affect where, when, and how fishing effort may be displaced, along with impacts to and responses of affected fish species.

Planned development overlaps right whale mother and calf migration corridors and a significant foraging habitat that is used throughout the year [@quintana-rizzo_residency_2021] (Fig \ref{fig:whales-wind}). Turbine presence and extraction of energy from the system could alter local oceanography [@christiansen_emergence_2022] and may affect right whale prey availability. For example, persistent foraging hotspots of right whales and seabirds overlap on Nantucket Shoals, where unique hydrography aggregates enhanced prey densities [@white_ducks_2020; @sorochan_narw_forage_2021]. Wind leases (OCS-A 0521 and OCS-A 0522) currently intersect these hotspots on the southwestern corner of Nantucket Shoals and a prominent tidal front associated with invertebrate prey swarms important to seabirds and possibly right whales. Proposed wind development areas also bring increased vessel strike risk to whales from construction and operation vessels, in addition to potential impacts such as displacement, increased levels of communication masking, and elevated stress hormones from pile driving and operational noise.

Scientific data collection surveys for ocean and ecosystem conditions, fish, and protected species will be altered, potentially increasing uncertainty for stock assessments and associated management decision making.

The increase of offshore wind development can have both positive (e.g., employment opportunities) and negative (e.g., space-use conflicts) effects. Continued increase in coastal development and gentrification pressure has resulted in loss of fishing infrastructure space within ports. Understanding these existing pressures can allow for avoiding and mitigating negative impacts to our shore support industry and communities dependent on fishing. Some of the communities with the highest fisheries revenue overlap with offshore wind development areas that are also vulnerable to gentrification pressure are Point Pleasant and Atlantic City, NJ, Ocean City, MD, and Beaufort, NC.

# Document Orientation

The figure format is illustrated in Fig \ref{fig:docformat}a. Trend lines are shown when slope is significantly different from 0 at the p < 0.05 level. An orange line signifies an overall positive trend, and purple signifies a negative trend. To minimize bias introduced by small sample size, no trend is fit for < 30 year time series. Dashed lines represent mean values of time series unless the indicator is an anomaly, in which case the dashed line is equal to 0. Shaded regions indicate the past ten years. If there are no new data for 2022, the shaded region will still cover this time period. The spatial scale of indicators is either coastwide, Mid-Atlantic states (New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina), or at the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) Ecosystem Production Unit (EPU, Fig. \ref{fig:docformat}b) level.
